## Spotify Offline/Local Control

Control Spotify locally, without an internet connection on both Windows and MacOS.
Makes use of the excellent [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app/) project to enable
injection into the Spotify app of a plugin to forward and receive data from Companion. 
Built with the [Spicetify Creator](https://spicetify.app/docs/development/spicetify-creator)
and [Typescript Companion Module Template][https://github.com/bitfocus/companion-module-template-ts].

To use:
1. Ensure Spicetify has been installed on your machine as per the instructions 
[here](https://spicetify.app/docs/getting-started).
2. Have Spicetify apply `companion-module.js` from this project.
3. Start using the actions in Companion.
